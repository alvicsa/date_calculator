## Project Description

The objective of this project is to create a program (using Python programming language) 
to calculate the number of full days elapsed in between two events. 

#### Design Constraints
The first and the last day are considered partial days and never counted. Following this
logic, the distance between two related events on 03/08/2018 and 04/08/2018 is 0,
since there are no fully elapsed days contained in between those, and 01/01/2000 to
03/01/2000 should return 1.

#### Technologies

Running this program requires Python (version 3.6 and above) interpreter installed 
on their system. If you see a version of Python earlier than Python 3.6, you
may download the latest Python interpreter from https://python.org/

```
You will be prompted to enter two dates. Please use the following format when entering: DD/MM/YYYY
